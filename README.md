This is a repository for solutions to tasks for Python language classes

Each group of tasks is contained in its own project

Individual projects should contain folders:
    documentation - additional documentation other than dosctrings in source code (in original formats as well as in pdf format)
    main - python modules
    tests - tests using python unittest uint testing framework

Individual projects should contain files:
    run.sh - run python module as `__main__`
    test.sh - run tests and static checks

In static checks:
    compliance with PEP8 is ensured
    type correctness is ensured

In documentation should be accessible in individual files:
    python docstrings should use reStructuredText format
